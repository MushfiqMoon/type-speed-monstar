        <h3>Difference between global scope and block scope</h3>
        <p><strong>Global Scope</strong> When we declare any variable it has specific scope we can only access that
          variable on that specific scope,
          When javascript program start before any function calls which we declare previously it will be on global
          scope, In a
          programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.</p>
        <p><strong>Block Level Scope:</strong> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific
          block,( exmp.- {} ) from access by
          the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to
          access the variables of that specific block, Variables declared with the
          var keyword, do not have block scope.</p>

        <h3>What is event loop in javascript</h3>
        <p>Event loop check if any function is exist or not on the Heap, If callstack is empty and there is no function
          on Heap then event loop wrap the function and send to call stack for execution, and this is the event loop</p>

        <h3>How many time we well get undefine </h3>
        <p>
          These are the eight resons when we will get undefine
        <ul>
          <li>variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
          <li> function with no return</li>
          <li> parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
          <li> if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
          <li> property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined</li>
          <li> accessing array elements outside of the index range</li>
          <li> deleting an element inside an array</li>
          <li> set a value directly to undefined</li>
